# Level 1 – Crop identification

## Overview

Be part of a movement to make science more accessible. Join this challenge to help create open-source solutions to address the UN Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger.
More than 800 million people regularly go to bed hungry.
Climate change is one of the main causes of hunger.
Better understanding crop yields and how to maximize efficiency of crops is an urgent need.
Though the scale of the problem is global, we must start by understanding a single crop at a single location.
Core: ```You will use radar and optical satellite data from Microsoft’s Planetary Computer to build a tool to identify rice crops in Vietnam.```
The team, or individual, placing first will receive: US$2,500.


## Why rice production in Vietnam?

In two words: applicability and imperative.
Vietnam is among the world’s leading rice producers and the Vietnamese obtain more than half their total calories from rice.
Also, Vietnam is among the most vulnerable to climate change, losing an estimated US$10b in 2020 to climate change according to the World Bank.
More broadly, rice is a staple food for more than four billion people and the livelihood for a fifth of the world’s population. But both the amount of land available for rice and the yield growth rates are in decline with irrigated rice yields in developing countries forecast to decrease by 15% due to climate change.
Simply put, solutions focused on this staple are scalable and could transform global rice production.


## Skills

There are no pre-requisites for taking part. 
1. It does help to have a basic understanding of math and statistics, as well as some experience in coding.
2. Participating will improve your skills in Python for data science, machine learning and managing large volumes of data. Here you can learn more: Open Science Data Challenge. https://challenge.ey.com/learnings
3. It also good to have existing knowledge on phenology curves and vegetation indices. Here you can learn more: Open Science Data Challenge. https://challenge.ey.com/learnings


## Completing the challenge

The time required to complete this level is approximately 30 hours.

Core: ```This challenge is to predict the presence of rice crop at 250 geo locations (latitude and longitude) in the An Giang province of Vietnam using satellite data.```

1. You will be given an example Jupyter notebook with a preliminary F1 score of 0.55. The notebook connects to public facing data sources on Microsoft’s Planetary Computer. 
2. The output of the notebook is a .csv file that can be uploaded to the challenge platform, which you can improve over the course of the challenge.
3. Watch this video to learn how to get started and make a submission and claim your spot on the EY Open Science Data Challenge ranking board. https://challenge.ey.com/getting-started-2023/help
4. Watch this video for some tips on how to improve your model performance. https://challenge.ey.com/challenge-2023-level-1/help
Opportunities for improvement include but are not limited to: explore other bands from Sentinel-1-RTC, use combinations of many bands from the Sentinel-1-RTC, generate various vegetation indices to be used as features, extract VV and VH band values for an entire year and summarize using time-series metrics, explore the approach of building a bounding box around the given latitude and longitude positions, try other classification algorithms, and hyperparameter tuning.
5. The output will be a rice crop classification model that can distinguish between a rice and non-rice field.
6. Identifying areas where rice is growing is important for prioritizing actions intended to ensure food security.
